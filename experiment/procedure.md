⭐ When you enter the simulation section, a guided tour will appear. It is strongly recommended that you take the tour for the first time, as it provides step-by-step instructions to help you understand the experiment thoroughly. The tour also introduces you to the various controls, features, and interface elements, making it easier for you to navigate and explore the experiment effectively.

## Task-1: Identifying Regions and Breakdown

- The simulation displays a visual representation of a PN junction diode.
- The P-region and N-region are clearly marked with different colors.
- The depletion region is shown in the center, with dashed borders.
- Observe the charge indicators (positive and negative charges) in each region.
- When the breakdown preset is selected, the diode visualization animates with sparks and a warning appears.
- **Your task:** Identify and label the P-region, N-region, and depletion region. Note the changes when breakdown occurs.

## Task-2: Exploring Electric Field and Charge Distribution

- Use the interactive controls panel to adjust parameters such as voltage and doping concentration.
- As you change these parameters, observe how the electric field lines and charge distribution update in real time.
- The electric field is visualized with animated lines and arrows.
- **Your task:** Experiment with different values and describe how the electric field and charge distribution change across the junction.

## Task-3: Measurement and Analysis

- The simulation provides a measurements section showing values like built-in potential, depletion width, and current.
- These values update as you interact with the controls.
- **Your task:** Record the measurements for different parameter settings and analyze how they relate to the physical behavior of the diode.

## Task-4: Challenges and Quizzes

- Navigate to the Challenge tab to attempt interactive quizzes and matching exercises.
- Label diagrams, answer multiple-choice questions, and fill in the blanks based on your observations.
- Immediate feedback is provided for each attempt.
- **Your task:** Complete the challenges to test your understanding of PN junction behavior.
