⭐ When you enter the simulation section, a guided tour will appear. It is strongly recommended that you take the tour for the first time, as it provides step-by-step instructions to help you understand the experiment thoroughly. The tour also introduces you to the various controls, features, and interface elements, making it easier for you to navigate and explore the experiment effectively.

## Task-1: Identifying Regions and Breakdown

1. Open the simulation and observe the visual representation of the PN junction diode.
2. Identify the P-region (shown in one color) on the left side of the junction.
3. Identify the N-region (shown in a different color) on the right side of the junction.
4. Locate the depletion region in the center, marked with dashed borders.
5. Observe the charge indicators:
   - Note the positive charges in the depletion region near the N-side
   - Note the negative charges in the depletion region near the P-side
6. Select the breakdown preset from the available options.
7. Watch the diode visualization animate with sparks and observe the warning message.
1. Locate the interactive controls panel on the simulation interface.
2. Set the initial voltage to 0V (zero bias condition).
3. Note the initial electric field distribution shown by animated lines and arrows.
4. Gradually increase the voltage in positive direction (forward bias):
   - Observe how the electric field lines change
   - Note the changes in depletion width
5. Reset the voltage to 0V.
6. Gradually decrease the voltage in negative direction (reverse bias):
   - Observe how the electric field intensifies
   - Note the increase in depletion width
7. Adjust the doping concentration parameter:
1. Locate the measurements section on the simulation interface.
2. Set the diode to zero bias condition (0V).
3. Record the following initial values:
   - Built-in potential (V₀)
   - Depletion width (W)
   - Current (I)
1. Click on the Challenge tab in the simulation interface.
2. Start with the diagram labeling exercise:
   - Drag and drop labels to the correct parts of the PN junction
   - Submit your answer
   - Review the feedback provided
3. Proceed to the multiple-choice questions:
   - Read each question carefully
   - Select your answer based on your observations from previous tasks
   - Check the immediate feedback
4. Complete the fill-in-the-blanks exercise:
   - Type your answers for each blank
   - Use the measurements and observations from Task-3 to guide your responses
5. Attempt the matching exercise:
   - Match concepts with their definitions
   - Match parameters with their effects on the diode
6. Review any incorrect answers and revisit the relevant sections of the simulation.
7. Retake the challenges if needed to achieve a perfect score
5. Increase forward bias to +0.5V and +0.7V:
   - Record measurements at each voltage level
   - Observe the exponential increase in current
6. Apply reverse bias voltage of -1V, -3V, and -5V:
   - Record depletion width at each voltage
   - Record the reverse saturation current
   - Note how depletion width increases with reverse voltage
7. Create a table with your recorded measurements.
8. Analyze the relationship between voltage, depletion width, and current
8. Record your observations for at least three different parameter combinations
- Use the interactive controls panel to adjust parameters such as voltage and doping concentration.
- As you change these parameters, observe how the electric field lines and charge distribution update in real time.
- The electric field is visualized with animated lines and arrows.
- **Your task:** Experiment with different values and describe how the electric field and charge distribution change across the junction.

## Task-3: Measurement and Analysis

- The simulation provides a measurements section showing values like built-in potential, depletion width, and current.
- These values update as you interact with the controls.
- **Your task:** Record the measurements for different parameter settings and analyze how they relate to the physical behavior of the diode.

## Task-4: Challenges and Quizzes

- Navigate to the Challenge tab to attempt interactive quizzes and matching exercises.
- Label diagrams, answer multiple-choice questions, and fill in the blanks based on your observations.
- Immediate feedback is provided for each attempt.
- **Your task:** Complete the challenges to test your understanding of PN junction behavior.
